# Spotify Playlist Duplicate Finder

This python program will find all the duplicate songs in your playlist with the same name and artist(s).

To set up, create a Spotify API application by navigation to https://developer.spotify.com. Log in and create a new app. Keep track of the client ID and secret.

Clone this repository. It consists of a hidden `.env` file. In that file, enter your client ID and secret. Then, run `find-duplicate.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.

Hope this helps. Credits to https://engineeringfordatascience.com/posts/export_spotify_playlist_to_csv_using_python/ for the client ID and secret setup portion.
